        <h2>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h2>
        <div class="text-left">
          <p class="text-center">Frequently asked questions (FAQ’s) are listed questions and answers, all supposed to be
            commonly
            asked in
            some context, and pertaining to a particular topic.</p>
          <h5>Q: Why is there no sample of the winning site posted anywhere?</h5>
          <p>A: The National Web Design contest is sponsored by the SkillsUSA organization. The short answer to your
            question is that the organization has asked the various contest participating not to publish the results of
            the winning teams. We would like to ask that you direct this question to your advisor who can further
            explore this question. </p>
          <h5>Q: Why is there no information on the written exam?</h5>
          <p>A: The National Web Design technical committee publishes a guideline for the contest that outlines the
            topics covered in detail. Given the nature of and the level of the competition, (nationals) it’s our goal
            that you be familiar enough with the topics covered in the classroom and be prepared for sitting for any
            exam or any exercise. That said, we recognize that the contest is new for many and that not everyone is
            aware of the contest rules available from the SkillsUSA organization. Get with your instructor and or
            adviser and ask them to contact their SkillsUSA representative for details. </p>
          <p>We also understand and appreciate that not everyone has access to the courses taught by other schools. As a
            professional organization of Web professionals we aim to improve upon that. To get a sense for our progress
            please check out our website WebProfessionals.org. Also, please ask your adviser or instructor to contact us
            for additional details and available resources for the classroom. Also, check out WebProfessionals.org
            certification website to explore the topics that might be covered on the exam. <a

          <h5>Q. Should not a rubric be provided to help students have a more level playing field?</h5>
          <p>A. We do publish one and update it every year. As we stated above, your teacher should have this and if not
            ask her/him to contact SkilsUSA for this.</p>
